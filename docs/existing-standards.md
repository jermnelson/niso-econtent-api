# Preexisting Work and Standards

## OpenID
The [OpenID][OID] is an interoperable authentication protocol built
upon the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) specifications using 
[REST][REST] and [JSON][JSON] message flows that allows websites and
mobile apps, and library systems to identify users once and 
share that authentication..

## NCIP 
[NCIP][NCIP], short for *[NISO][NISO] Circulation Interchange
Protocol*, also known as Z39.83, specifies a standard for 
automating tasks and data interchange for library circulation 
workflows.

## BIC LCF
The [Library Communications Framework (LCF)][LCF] is a set of 
library interoperability standards which defines a framework for 
the communication of data between self-service and other library 
terminal applications  to and from library management systems. This 
LCF standard is recommended by BIC as the best way to implement 
communications between systems within a library, for example 
between a Library Management System (LMS/ILS) and an RFID Self-Service 
Solution

## BIC Library WebServices
[BIC Libraries Web Services][BICWS] Task & Finish Working Group is 
charged with developing of a suite of BIC Web Services specifically 
designed for use in libraries. It will imitate the successful BIC 
Realtime methodology already in use by BIC to develop web services 
for the trade. The formal deliverables are a new suite of BIC Library 
web services, including a number of new message pairs, with accompanying 
guidelines documentation/Implementation Checklist and FAQs


## ResourceSync
[ResourceSync][RS] is a resource synchronization framework with a 
specification that is jointly sponsored by [NISO][NISO] 
and [Open Archives](http://www.openarchives.org/).
