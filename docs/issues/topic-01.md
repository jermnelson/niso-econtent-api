# Path to Resource

##  Comments from [Best Practice Review][BEST_PRACTICES] Topic ID #1
Path from finding a resource to accessing it should be intuitive, 
seamless and offer few/no barriers to the end user.  The user should 
not have to leave the environment in which the resource was found. 
The resource should be displayed within the library catalogue/discovery 
layer and should not be taken to a third party website, e.g., publisher 
or aggregator site.
