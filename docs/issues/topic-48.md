# Replace Patron Barcode

##  Comments from [Best Practice Review][BEST_PRACTICES] Topic ID #48
APIs should make the transition from one card to another (assuring 
security in case of stolen cards)  seamless, allowing content from 
an earlier library barcode to remain in the account even if the barcode 
is updated.
