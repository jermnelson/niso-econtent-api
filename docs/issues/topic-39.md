# Persistence of Curation Data
If an e-resource is coming from a curated collection, information about the curation should not be lost to the catalog display.

##  Comments from [Best Practice Review][BEST_PRACTICES] Topic ID #39

If we are paying for content (including metadata) available on the vendor's
proprietary site, we should be able to move that data to our portal. 

For example, [BiblioBoard](https://biblioboard.com/) provides categories 
and [Freegal](https://www.freegalmusic.com/) provides lists such as 
"top 10 artists." Both of these are not available outside their 
proprietary systems.
