# Persistence of Curation Data
If an e-resource is coming from a curated collection, information about the curation should not be lost to the catalog display.

If we are paying for content (including metadata) available on the vendor's
proprietary site, we should be able to move that data to our portal. 

For example, [BiblioBoard](https://biblioboard.com/) provides categories 
and [Freegal](https://www.freegalmusic.com/) provides lists such as 
"top 10 artists." Both of these are not available outside their 
proprietary systems.
