# Welcome to Flexible API STandard for E-content NISO (FASTEN) 

Documentation related to the [NISO Working Group](http://www.niso.org/standards-committees/fasten)
on a library-vendor interoperability standard using [REST][REST]ful Web services 
API that supports mobile applications. 


## Existing Standards
This document attempts to align potential REST API service points with existing Library and
Internet standards, with the initial focus being [ResourceSync][RS], [NCIP][NCIP] (both
existing NISO standards) and [OpenID][OID]. Other standards and protocols will be added 
if/when time permits. 

## API Mapping 
Using a [pre-existing Google document][BEST_PRACTICES] on suggested Best Practices, specific 
topics are used as a starting point to map to [OpenID][OID], [ResourceSync][RS], and 
[NCIP][NCIP] standards.
